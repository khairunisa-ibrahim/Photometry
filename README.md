# Photometry
This matlab code was created for Jose Moron-Concepcion's lab to analyze fiber photometry recording with manually scored timestamps using OpenScope. 
It was created using the multiple examples found on the TDT website.

This is the functional code created to do the initial analysis for the CFA vs Saline neural activity experiment. This code requires the recording to be manually scored using OpenScope.


#### PhotometrydFFAnalysis_9Dec19
The code is streamlined to focus on percentage dF/F change of the CFA vs Saline neural activity experiment. This code requires the recording to be manually scored using OpenScope.


#### PhotometryZScoreAnalysis_18May20
The code is streamlined to focus on Z-score of the CFA vs Saline neural activity experiment. This code requires the recording to be manually scored using OpenScope.


#### PhotometrydFFAnalysis_vGlut2_5June20
The code focus on percentage dF/F change of the dHPC stimu - NAc photometry experiment. The dHPC is stimulated every 30s for a duration of 30ms per pulse for 30 minutes. This code requires the recording to be manually scored using OpenScope.
